This project aims to implement a notification badge in Facebook style. It will have a count of all the unseen notifications. When the user clicks on the bell, a menu opens with all the notifications and the counter resets. The user can mark a single notification as read by clicking on it. The user also can mark all the notifications as read by clicking a link. Another link in the bottom says "See all" this will open a page with the complete number of notifications (not implemented in this project).

This is not a library or a module to include in another project, it is just an example to illustrate how to implement a notification badge system.
